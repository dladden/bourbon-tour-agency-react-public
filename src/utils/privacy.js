Stripe is a PCI Service Provider Level 1 that provides the highest market security level. At the same time, we utilize Auth0 for user authentication to protect the user and our business. Auth0 uses OAuth 2 as a standard protocol to implement authorization allowing users to grant limited access to their resources on one site. Additionally, you can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser or looking for 'https' at the beginning of the address of the web page.
